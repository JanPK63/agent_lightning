FEATURES:
- Universal path analyzer for ANY path (local/remote)
- Agents perform REAL analysis instead of approaches
- SSH integration with project config
- Works with fabric-api-gateway-modular and any directory
- Tested and working

KEY FILES:
- enhanced_production_api.py (updated with universal analyzer)
- universal_path_analyzer.py (new universal path system)
- project_config.py (SSH configuration)

AGENT CAPABILITY:
✅ Analyze local paths: /Users/...
✅ Analyze remote paths: fabric-api-gateway-modular
✅ Extract paths from natural language
✅ Execute real SSH commands
✅ Provide concrete analysis results

TEST RESULTS:
✅ Local analysis: /Users/jankootstra/agent-lightning-main
✅ Remote analysis: fabric-api-gateway-modular on Ubuntu server
✅ Agent execution: Real SSH commands executed
✅ Path extraction: Works with natural language

PROBLEM SOLVED:
Agents now perform actual work instead of giving approaches.
They can analyze ANY path you provide - local or remote.
