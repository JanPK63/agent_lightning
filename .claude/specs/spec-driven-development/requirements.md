# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Specification-Driven Development (SDD) feature enables a development workflow where specifications are the primary artifacts that generate code, rather than merely guiding it. This system transforms natural language specifications into executable artifacts through AI-assisted generation, maintaining alignment between intent and implementation throughout the software development lifecycle. The feature provides commands and templates to create structured specifications, generate implementation plans, and produce code that adheres to architectural principles defined in a project constitution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Feature Specification Creation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create structured feature specifications from simple descriptions, so that I can quickly transform ideas into comprehensive requirements documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a feature description THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a unique feature number by scanning existing specifications
2. WHEN generating a feature specification THEN the system SHALL create a semantic branch name from the description AND create the branch automatically in version control
3. WHEN creating a specification THEN the system SHALL use a predefined template structure that includes user stories, acceptance criteria, and non-functional requirements sections
4. WHEN the template is populated THEN the system SHALL mark all ambiguous or unclear requirements with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
5. IF the user's description lacks specific details THEN the system SHALL NOT make assumptions but SHALL mark those areas for clarification
6. WHEN a specification is created THEN the system SHALL store it in a `specs/[branch-name]/` directory structure

### Requirement 2: Implementation Plan Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate detailed implementation plans from feature specifications, so that I can translate business requirements into technical architecture and actionable tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a feature specification exists THEN the system SHALL be able to generate a comprehensive implementation plan
2. WHEN generating an implementation plan THEN the system SHALL analyze the feature specification for requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria
3. WHEN creating technical details THEN the system SHALL include data models, API contracts, and test scenarios in separate supporting documents
4. IF architectural principles are defined in a project constitution THEN the system SHALL ensure the implementation plan complies with those principles
5. WHEN the plan includes technology choices THEN the system SHALL document the rationale and link each choice back to specific requirements
6. WHEN generating the plan THEN the system SHALL create it in a `specs/[branch-name]/implementation-plan.md` file with supporting documents in an `implementation-details/` subdirectory

### Requirement 3: Constitutional Compliance and Enforcement

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want the system to enforce architectural principles consistently, so that all generated code maintains system integrity and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project constitution exists THEN the system SHALL validate all implementation plans against the defined articles
2. IF the constitution defines a library-first principle THEN the system SHALL structure all features as standalone libraries with clear boundaries
3. IF the constitution mandates test-first development THEN the system SHALL generate tests before implementation code
4. WHEN architectural gates are defined THEN the system SHALL include pre-implementation checkpoints in the plan
5. IF a gate fails THEN the system SHALL require documented justification in a "Complexity Tracking" section
6. WHEN principles conflict with requirements THEN the system SHALL flag the conflict and request clarification

### Requirement 4: Iterative Specification Refinement

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to iteratively refine specifications through AI-assisted dialogue, so that requirements become comprehensive and unambiguous.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing a specification THEN the system SHALL identify edge cases, ambiguities, and gaps
2. WHEN clarification is needed THEN the system SHALL ask specific, targeted questions rather than open-ended ones
3. IF the user updates requirements THEN the system SHALL automatically flag affected technical decisions in the implementation plan
4. WHEN specifications change THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and track the evolution of requirements
5. WHEN refinement is complete THEN the system SHALL validate that no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
6. IF production metrics or incidents occur THEN the system SHALL support updating specifications based on operational feedback

### Requirement 5: Research and Context Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically research technical options and constraints, so that specifications are informed by real-world considerations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating specifications THEN the system SHALL research relevant libraries, frameworks, and best practices
2. WHEN evaluating technology options THEN the system SHALL investigate compatibility, performance benchmarks, and security implications
3. IF organizational constraints exist THEN the system SHALL automatically apply database standards, authentication requirements, and deployment policies
4. WHEN research is conducted THEN the system SHALL document findings and cite sources within the specification
5. IF multiple implementation approaches exist THEN the system SHALL present options with pros and cons for each
6. WHEN technical constraints are discovered THEN the system SHALL update the specification to reflect these limitations

### Requirement 6: Template-Driven Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want templates to guide specification creation, so that all specifications maintain consistent quality and completeness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using templates THEN the system SHALL enforce proper abstraction levels, keeping business requirements separate from implementation details
2. WHEN templates include checklists THEN the system SHALL use them to validate specification completeness
3. IF templates define information architecture THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate detail levels in main documents and extract complexity to separate files
4. WHEN creating test specifications THEN the system SHALL enforce test-first thinking with proper ordering of test types
5. IF speculative features are proposed THEN the system SHALL reject them unless they trace back to concrete user stories
6. WHEN templates are updated THEN the system SHALL apply new constraints to future specifications while maintaining backward compatibility

### Requirement 7: Code Generation from Specifications

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate working code from specifications and implementation plans, so that implementation accurately reflects documented requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifications and plans are stable THEN the system SHALL generate code that implements the defined requirements
2. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL transform domain concepts into data models, user stories into API endpoints, and acceptance scenarios into tests
3. IF the specification changes THEN the system SHALL support regenerating affected code sections
4. WHEN multiple implementation targets exist THEN the system SHALL generate code for different optimization goals (performance, maintainability, cost)
5. IF generated code has issues THEN the system SHALL trace problems back to specification gaps or ambiguities
6. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL maintain traceability between specification elements and code components

### Requirement 8: Version Control and Branching Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want specifications to integrate with version control, so that specification evolution is tracked alongside code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a feature specification THEN the system SHALL automatically create and checkout a feature branch
2. WHEN specifications are modified THEN the system SHALL track changes in version control with meaningful commit messages
3. IF multiple team members work on specifications THEN the system SHALL support branching, merging, and conflict resolution
4. WHEN a specification is approved THEN the system SHALL support creating pull requests with linked specifications
5. IF specifications exist in branches THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicts by enforcing unique feature numbers
6. WHEN merging specifications THEN the system SHALL validate consistency across merged documents

### Requirement 9: Manual Testing Plan Generation

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want the system to generate manual testing procedures from specifications, so that validation aligns with documented requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an implementation plan exists THEN the system SHALL generate step-by-step manual testing procedures
2. WHEN creating test procedures THEN the system SHALL map each procedure to specific user stories and acceptance criteria
3. IF edge cases are identified in specifications THEN the system SHALL include them in manual test scenarios
4. WHEN test procedures are generated THEN the system SHALL organize them by priority and functional area
5. IF prerequisites exist for testing THEN the system SHALL document setup and teardown procedures
6. WHEN validation procedures are created THEN the system SHALL include expected results and failure criteria

### Requirement 10: Continuous Specification Validation

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want continuous validation of specifications, so that quality issues are identified early and consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifications are created or modified THEN the system SHALL automatically check for ambiguities, contradictions, and gaps
2. IF validation issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback on what needs correction
3. WHEN requirements reference each other THEN the system SHALL validate that all references are valid and consistent
4. IF specifications become inconsistent with code THEN the system SHALL flag the divergence for resolution
5. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL check against both structural templates and semantic consistency
6. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent code generation until issues are resolved
