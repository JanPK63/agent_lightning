# Multi-Agent Collaboration Patterns and Architectures Research

## Executive Summary
This document outlines research findings on multi-agent collaboration patterns suitable for Agent Lightning implementation. The research covers established patterns, communication protocols, and architectural approaches for enabling multiple AI agents to work together effectively.

## 1. Core Multi-Agent System (MAS) Patterns

### 1.1 Master-Worker Pattern (Hierarchical)
**Description:** One master agent coordinates multiple worker agents.

**Characteristics:**
- Centralized control and decision-making
- Master decomposes tasks and assigns to workers
- Workers report results back to master
- Master aggregates results

**Use Cases:**
- Parallel data processing
- Distributed computing tasks
- Map-reduce operations

**Implementation for Agent Lightning:**
```python
class MasterAgent:
    def decompose_task(self, complex_task):
        # Break into subtasks
        return subtasks
    
    def assign_work(self, subtask, worker):
        # Assign to best-suited worker
        pass
    
    def aggregate_results(self, worker_results):
        # Combine into final result
        return final_result
```

### 1.2 Peer-to-Peer Pattern (Decentralized)
**Description:** Agents communicate directly with each other without central coordinator.

**Characteristics:**
- No single point of failure
- Agents negotiate directly
- Self-organizing behavior
- Dynamic role assignment

**Use Cases:**
- Collaborative problem solving
- Resource sharing
- Consensus building

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
class PeerAgent:
    def broadcast_capability(self):
        # Announce what I can do
        pass
    
    def negotiate_task(self, task, peers):
        # Decide who does what
        pass
    
    def share_result(self, result, peers):
        # Share findings with relevant peers
        pass
```

### 1.3 Blackboard Pattern (Shared Knowledge)
**Description:** Agents collaborate through shared knowledge repository.

**Characteristics:**
- Common knowledge base
- Asynchronous collaboration
- Event-driven updates
- Pattern matching triggers

**Use Cases:**
- Complex reasoning tasks
- Knowledge accumulation
- Hypothesis testing

**Implementation Concept:**
```python
class Blackboard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge = {}
        self.subscribers = []
    
    def post_knowledge(self, agent_id, knowledge):
        # Add to blackboard
        self.notify_subscribers(knowledge)
    
    def query_knowledge(self, criteria):
        # Retrieve relevant knowledge
        return filtered_knowledge
```

### 1.4 Contract Net Protocol (Market-Based)
**Description:** Agents bid on tasks based on capabilities.

**Characteristics:**
- Task announcement
- Bidding process
- Contract awarding
- Performance monitoring

**Use Cases:**
- Resource allocation
- Task distribution
- Load balancing

**Implementation Framework:**
```python
class ContractNetManager:
    def announce_task(self, task_spec):
        # Broadcast task to agents
        pass
    
    def collect_bids(self, deadline):
        # Gather agent proposals
        return bids
    
    def award_contract(self, bids):
        # Select best bidder
        return winner
```

## 2. Communication Protocols

### 2.1 Agent Communication Language (ACL)
**FIPA ACL Standard Messages:**
- `inform`: Share information
- `request`: Ask for action
- `query`: Ask for information
- `propose`: Suggest action
- `accept/reject`: Response to proposal
- `subscribe`: Register for updates

**Message Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class AgentMessage:
    performative: str  # inform, request, query, etc.
    sender: str
    receiver: str
    content: Any
    conversation_id: str
    reply_by: datetime
    ontology: str
    language: str
```

### 2.2 Event-Driven Communication
**Pub-Sub Pattern:**
```python
class EventBus:
    def publish(self, event_type, data):
        # Notify all subscribers
        pass
    
    def subscribe(self, event_type, handler):
        # Register for events
        pass
```

### 2.3 Direct Messaging
**Point-to-Point Communication:**
```python
class MessageQueue:
    def send(self, recipient, message):
        # Direct message delivery
        pass
    
    def receive(self, timeout=None):
        # Get messages for agent
        pass
```

## 3. Coordination Mechanisms

### 3.1 Task Decomposition Strategies

**Functional Decomposition:**
- Break by functionality (frontend, backend, database)
- Assign to specialists

**Data Decomposition:**
- Split by data segments
- Process in parallel

**Temporal Decomposition:**
- Sequential task phases
- Pipeline processing

### 3.2 Synchronization Methods

**Barrier Synchronization:**
- Wait for all agents to complete
- Proceed together to next phase

**Leader Election:**
- Dynamic coordinator selection
- Failover handling

**Consensus Protocols:**
- Voting mechanisms
- Byzantine fault tolerance

### 3.3 Conflict Resolution

**Priority-Based:**
- Agent ranking
- Task criticality

**Negotiation:**
- Multi-round bidding
- Compromise algorithms

**Arbitration:**
- Third-party mediator
- Rule-based resolution

## 4. Implementation Architecture for Agent Lightning

### 4.1 Proposed Hybrid Architecture

Combine multiple patterns for flexibility:

```python
class CollaborationOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.master_worker = MasterWorkerCoordinator()
        self.peer_network = PeerToPeerNetwork()
        self.blackboard = SharedBlackboard()
        self.contract_net = ContractNetProtocol()
    
    def select_collaboration_mode(self, task_complexity, agent_count):
        if task_complexity == "simple" and agent_count < 3:
            return self.peer_network
        elif task_complexity == "complex" and agent_count > 5:
            return self.master_worker
        elif task_complexity == "knowledge_intensive":
            return self.blackboard
