## Success Metrics

- **Agent Selection Accuracy**: >95% correct assignments
- **Task Completion Rate**: >90% successful execution
- **False Positive Rate**: <1% tasks marked complete without work
- **System Uptime**: >99.9%
- **Response Time**: <100ms for task assignment
- **Audit Coverage**: 100% of operations logged

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test "hello world website" task goes to web_developer/coder
- [ ] Test security tasks go to security_expert
- [ ] Test tasks are actually executed
- [ ] Test failed tasks are not marked complete
- [ ] Test all operations are logged
- [ ] Test system handles agent failures
- [ ] Test load balancing works
- [ ] Test monitoring catches issues

## Notes

- Current state: Framework is structurally present but functionally broken
- Main issue: Agent selection and task verification
- Impact: Not enterprise-ready, barely prototype-ready
- Required: Complete overhaul of orchestration layer
- Timeline: 4 weeks for full fix implementation
