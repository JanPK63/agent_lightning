# Agent Lightning - Fixed System Usage Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
Your agents were describing tasks instead of executing them. This has been fixed!

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Start the Fixed System:**
   ```bash
   python3 fixed_agent_api.py
   ```

2. **Test That It Works:**
   ```bash
   python3 test_fixed_agents.py
   ```

## ðŸ“¡ API Endpoints

### List Available Agents
```bash
curl http://localhost:8888/agents
```

### Execute a Task (THE FIX!)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/execute \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "task": "Create a Python function to sort a list",
       "agent_id": "full_stack_developer"
     }'
```

### Chat with an Agent
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/chat/full_stack_developer \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "How do I optimize database queries?"}'
```

## ðŸ¤– Available Agents

- **full_stack_developer**: Complete web development
- **data_scientist**: Data analysis and ML
- **security_expert**: Security analysis and secure coding
- **devops_engineer**: Infrastructure and deployment
- **system_architect**: System design and architecture

## âœ¨ What's Fixed

1. **Actual Execution**: Agents now perform tasks instead of describing them
2. **AI Integration**: Proper connection to OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
3. **Auto Selection**: Smart agent selection based on task content
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and timeouts
5. **Real Results**: Agents provide code, implementations, and solutions

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

Set your API keys (optional - system works with mock responses):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

Your agents now actually work! They will:
- Write actual code
- Provide complete implementations
- Create working solutions
- Execute tasks properly

No more "here's what you should do" - they now DO IT!
